C++ Tutorial Code

The goal of this project was to develop a simple c++ program that helps explain the language.

This code is not related to the cplusplus.com website in any way except that the lessons in
the cplusplus.com language tutorial are used as a basis for instruction.

This code simply attempts to outline and document the language in sections while providing an interactive console app experience.
